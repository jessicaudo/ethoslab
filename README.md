# ethoslab

Ethọ́s Lab exists to empower youth to transform community and shift culture. Ethọ́s Lab is leveraging the cooperative model to develop an online collaborative platform and creative co-working spaces for youth ages 12-18. Building on the design of 20+ young people, this web-app allows them experience learning, growing and socializing in a virtual world. This platform will be uniquely designed and curated with tools and equipment intended to deliver experiences that incite curiosity and build community. 

Integral to this model is culture and STEM focused exploration where youth can co-create their experience to promote personal growth and development. We are committed to building leadership capacity within the Black community in imagining and development spaces of innovation
